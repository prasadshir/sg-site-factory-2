## Gain Practical Experience

Reviewing this study guide alone will not prepare you to pass the certification exam. You need to have some real-life, practical experience to attempt the exam. For this purpose, we recommend that you gain practical experience by working with at least 2-3 real life projects.

## Perform Self Assessment

Once you decide to take the exam, we recommend that you study the \[domains and topics\]\(/exam-domains.md\) covered by the exam and their relative weightings. You should also perform a \[self assessment\]\(/self-assessment.md\) of your own areas of strength and weakness vis-a-vis the domains and topics covered by the exam blueprint. This is a recommended starting point for experienced Drupal 8 Developers.

## Appear for Exam

At this stage, you should be ready to take the exam! Follow the '**Schedule A Test**' link on [https://www.acquia.com/solutions/customer-success/acquia-certification](https://www.acquia.com/solutions/customer-success/acquia-certification).
